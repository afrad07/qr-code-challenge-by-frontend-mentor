My process:

Built with:
 Semantic HTML5 markup
 CSS custom properties

What I learned:
 One of the key takeaways from this project was improving responsiveness using the position property, particularly with the left attribute. This allowed me to control the positioning of 
 elements dynamically based on screen size. Hereâ€™s a snippet of how I applied it:

 css
 Copy code
.element {
  position: absolute;
  left: 50%;
}
This approach helped me position elements accurately for various screen sizes.

Continued development
I plan to further improve my skills in responsiveness, especially focusing on complex layouts and how to handle multiple breakpoints effectively.
